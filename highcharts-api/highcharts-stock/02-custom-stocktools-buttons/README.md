# Stock Exercise 2 - Custom Stocktools Buttons

Create a function that will serve you a random data.

Create a custom Stock tools button, which will be responsible for toggling the live data update.
This button should behave like any other built-in stock tools button.

Add any icon to that button (custom-created, fetched from the internet, or added to the local project).
For a reference, please take a look at the gif below.
