# Stock Exercise 6 - Advanced Annotations

Figure out why this annotation is not working, without changing the x and y
properties values.

After fixing it, create an HTML button. On click of that button, add a rectangle
draggable annotation to the chart. To that annotation, add a label (that will be
attached to the rectangle, and will drag together with it). Then, change the
label’s text to some dynamic value, for example annotation’s x or y value.
