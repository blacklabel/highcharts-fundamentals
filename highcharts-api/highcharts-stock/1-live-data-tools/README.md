# Stock exercise 1

Find live data or set up a server that will serve you a live data.
Create two charts on the same page - first with data A, second with data B. Add StockTools to both charts.

On a chart A: add 2 indicators to separate yAxes and set a specific custom DataGrouping.

On a chart B: Add to the StockTools group of buttons (opening list) that will allow you to set different DataGrouping options.

To both charts: add a "Live button" to the StockTools which will disable/enable live data update.
