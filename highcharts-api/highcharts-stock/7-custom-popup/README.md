# Stock exercise 7

Create a custom popup for annotation module. After adding annotation, when clicking on the edit button (see gif below)
the modal window should show in the middle of the chart, with a simple form. There should be one input field, which allows the user to change the title of the annotation, and the submit button. When the submit button is clicked, the custom popup should dissapear, and the options should be applied to the annotation.
