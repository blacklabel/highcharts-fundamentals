# Exercise 5 - Click Mousemove Cursor

Render a blue circle following the cursor. Save it on click like shown on the
GIF below. The saved points should have a label next to them with coordinates in
axis units. Make sure the chart is responsive (e.g. when resizing the window), the points are in the right
position when changing the chart width.
