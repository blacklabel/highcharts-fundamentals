# Exercise 16 - Heatmap HSV

Create a `Heatmap` series type with a following dataset:
It should be a two-dimentional array, where each with its x position spanning between 1-360 with interval equal to 1, and its y position spnning between 0-1 with its interval equal to 0.01. The value of each point should have a color representing the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) color format. The value from xAxis should be responsible for a Hue.

There should be a toggle button, which is changing, which other value between Saturation and Value should be represended by an yAxis, with other value constant for a current chart.
There should also be a slider, which will be changing the current value of a value mentioned in the line above, to be constant for a current chart.
