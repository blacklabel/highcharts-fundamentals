# exercise 15
Create a `Heatmap` series type with a following dataset:
It should be a two-dimentional array, where each with its x position spanning between 1-360 with interval equal to 1, and its y position spnning between 0-1 with its interval equal to 0.01. The value of each point should have a color representing the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) color format. The value from xAxis should be responsible for a Hue.

There should be a toggle button, which is changing, which other value between Saturation and Value should be represended by an yAxis, with other value constant for a current chart.
There should also be a slider, which will be changing the current value of a value mentioned in the line above, to be constant for a current chart.

Check the gif below for a reference.
<!-- Create a Heatmap series type, where each point has a different color changing in HSV (Hue Saturation Value) color format.
xAxis should be responsible for Hue.

There should be 2 radio buttons which are responsible for changing yAxis between Saturation and Value. -->
