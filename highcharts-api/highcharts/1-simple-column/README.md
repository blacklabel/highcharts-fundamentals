# exercise 1

Generate 3 column series with random data (0 <= y <= 10). Find the highest column (or columns) and display “max” label above.
Set `yAxis.max` to be exactly 2 times greater that the `y` of the max column. Try to find info about why `yAxis.max` sometimes it's not that easy to set a specific `yAxis.max` (depending on data).
Add yAxis plotLine with a value of 1.5 * the `y` of the max column.
