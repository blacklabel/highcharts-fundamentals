# Highcharts Fundamentals

This training is created to get familiar with the Highcharts library.
During this course, you will work on all the most popular series types, used by
Highcharts customers. You will work on Highcharts products, like Maps, Stock,
Exporting etc. All the exercises are grouped in separate folders,
containing plain js and HTML files, with task descriptions.

## Process
Whenever some task is ready, prepare a PR with a working demo on a separate
branch and assign the appropriate trainer for the review, to be
informed when the task is completed and ready for feedback. The branch should be
named with the name of the task set folder and the task name, e.g.:
`highcharts/00-initial-chart` or `highcharts-gantt/02-journeys-visualization`.
The PR name should be the same as the branch name.

The current version contains tasks only for Highcharts Core. In the near future,
there will be tasks for Stock, Maps, and Gantt.

Good luck!
