# Highcharts Fundamentals

This training is created for getting familiar with the Highcharts library.
During this course, you will work on all the most popular series types, used by
Highcharts customers. You will work on Highcharts products, like Maps, Stock,
Exporting etc. All the excercises are grouped in the separate folders,
containing plain js and html files, with task description.

## Process
Whenever some task is ready, on the separate branch prepare a PR with working
demo, so the code might be reviewed by trainer. The branch should be named with
the name of the task set folder and the task name, e.g.:
`highcharts/00-initial-chart` or `highcharts-gantt/02-journeys-visualization`

The current version contains tasks only for Highcharts Core. In the near future,
there will be tasks for Stock, Maps and Gantt.

Good luck!
